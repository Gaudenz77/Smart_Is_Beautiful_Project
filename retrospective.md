# Retrospective
* firstly i was not sure if we do it as real solo-project. I felt a bit noverwhelmed by the task but took it on. I was a bit irritated, when we did almost all important steps together. I'd actually have preferred to do it all myself but with two weeks instead of one. For not being sure what we would do together the next day, i felt a bit held back in really doing more by myself when its done different the next day anyways...
* Interesting project. Lots of help by trainers, trainees and lots of googleing myself
---
## General Feelings During Project
* Pleasant experoience overall, I think I learned a lot and move forward in zunderstanding programming
----
## Problems faced
* See above. Main problem was the insecuirity if we would do it together or all alone as solo project.
## For the next time I suggest do one or the other, either full solo with help, but more time, or do it not as project butr as kind of workshop in a week as we kind of did now.
## Final thoughts
* As always thanks for all the patience and the time you trainers and friends in this course spared to help me understand and learn. 
Thanks
