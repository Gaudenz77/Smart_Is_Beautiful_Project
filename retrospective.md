# Retrospective
---
## General Feelings During Project
* Tobias: We were great completion one to another, where bot understood the task as well as the tools in Use. Wher Gaudenz knew some things about layouting as such, I could teach him a lot in coding.
* Gaudenz: It was very helpful that Tobias took his time to work hard but always explained to me what he was doing.
* Good work-life balance
* it was funny als doing the pair-programming in the beginning
----
## Problems faced
* Github synchronization was very harsh. Sometimes it took things into code that we changed, sometimes it didn't. We are not sure if there was a probÃ¶lem with the basic setup at the start. 
* SOLUTION: We test it out in a sample-project to learn how to do it correctly. The Github-problems lead to time-problems and lots of not fully finished elements (folder structure, website basic layout, missingjavascript-number validation)

## Final thoughts
* A great project to try out various skills.
* We used Miro instead of figma. Miro is rathern intuitive, but not web dev specific as Figma is when used correctly.
* => get more info still on Figma (and Miro).
* basic planing was good. The use of type-based-question-setting with PHP
